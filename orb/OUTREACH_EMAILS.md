## THERMAL FEA EMAILS

### Email #9: Predictive Engineering (George Laird)

**To:** George.Laird@PredictiveEngineering.com
**Subject:** Thermal FEA Quote — Sealed Consumer Electronics (85mm sphere)

```
Hi George,

I'm developing a sealed consumer electronics product and need thermal
analysis to validate the design before committing to prototyping.

DEVICE SPECIFICATIONS:
• Form factor: 85mm sealed sphere (no vents)
• Shell: Acrylic, 7.5mm wall thickness
• Internal volume: 70mm diameter

HEAT SOURCES:
• QCS6490 SoC: 5W idle, 8W active, 12W peak
• Hailo-10H AI: 0.5W idle, 2.5W active, 5W peak
• Display: 0.3-1.2W
• Other (sensors, LEDs): ~2W
• Total: 6.7W idle, 13.8W active, 22.7W peak

THERMAL CONSTRAINTS:
• Surface temperature: ≤45°C (UL 62368-1 safe touch)
• Internal peak: ≤70°C (electronics survival)
• Ambient: 20-30°C

OPERATING MODES:
1. Docked (on maglev base): Base provides thermal coupling
2. Portable (handheld): Sphere only, must throttle

WHAT I NEED:
• Transient thermal analysis (2-hour soak test scenarios)
• Multiple power profiles (idle, active, peak burst)
• Temperature mapping of internal components
• Recommendations for thermal spreading optimization
• Go/no-go assessment for the sealed design

I have CAD models and can provide detailed component placement.

Could you provide a rough quote and timeline for this analysis?

Thank you,
Tim Jacoby

P.S. I saw Predictive Engineering is in Portland — happy to meet in person
if that would be helpful for scoping.
