## Slide 1: The Universal Betrayal

**Shot:** `dialogue` | **Camera:** `medium` | **Mood:** `excited`
**Duration:** 17.626s

### Key Points:
- Universal experience
- Summer ritual
- Sudden agony

### Script:

> Every summer, millions of people experience the exact same betrayal. You're at a party, a beach, a backyard barbecue. You take a big bite of ice cream or a long sip of a frozen drink. And then your brain tries to kill you.

## Slide 2: The Question Everyone Asks

**Shot:** `reverse` | **Camera:** `medium` | **Mood:** `excited`
**Duration:** 15.451s

### Key Points:
- Cold in mouth
- Pain in head
- Seems impossible

### Script:

> Why does eating something cold hurt your HEAD? The cold thing is in your mouth. Your brain is encased in bone, insulated by fluid. How does cold ice cream cause pain in your skull? It seems impossible.

## Slide 3: Meet the Trigeminal Nerve

**Shot:** `cutaway` | **Camera:** `medium` | **Mood:** `excited`
**Duration:** 14.718s

### Key Points:
- Largest cranial nerve
- Controls facial sensation
- Direct palate connection

### Script:

> The answer lies in your trigeminal nerve, the largest nerve in your head. This nerve controls facial sensation and is directly connected to your palate. When extreme cold hits, the trigeminal nerve goes haywire.

## Slide 4: The Blood Vessel Cascade

**Shot:** `cutaway` | **Camera:** `medium` | **Mood:** `excited`
**Duration:** 15.196s

### Key Points:
- Anterior cerebral artery
- Constrict → Dilate
- Pain receptor activation

### Script:

> Cold triggers your anterior cerebral artery to rapidly constrict, reducing blood flow. Your body panics and immediately dilates the artery. This constriction-dilation cycle triggers nearby pain receptors.

## Slide 5: The Referred Pain Trick

**Shot:** `dialogue` | **Camera:** `medium` | **Mood:** `warm`
**Duration:** 14.809s

### Key Points:
- Neural confusion
- Referred pain
- Mouth → Forehead

### Script:

> Here's the wild part: your brain gets confused about WHERE the pain is coming from. The trigeminal nerve serves both your palate and your forehead. So pain signals from your mouth get misinterpreted as coming from your head.

## Slide 6: The Tongue Trick

**Shot:** `dialogue` | **Camera:** `medium` | **Mood:** `warm`
**Duration:** 10.922s

### Key Points:
- Tongue to palate
- Warmth stabilizes
- Instant relief

### Script:

> Press your tongue flat against the roof of your mouth. The warmth from your tongue warms the palate, telling your blood vessels to stabilize. Pain relief is almost instant.

## Slide 7: The Slow Sip Strategy

**Shot:** `reverse` | **Camera:** `medium` | **Mood:** `warm`
**Duration:** 9.524s

### Key Points:
- Eat slowly
- Warm in mouth first
- Prevention > cure

### Script:

> Prevention is even better. Eat cold things slowly. Let them warm slightly in the front of your mouth before swallowing. Your blood vessels will thank you.

## Slide 8: Beyond Ice Cream

**Shot:** `dialogue` | **Camera:** `medium` | **Mood:** `warm`
**Duration:** 12.754s

### Key Points:
- Migraine research
- Vascular studies
- Pain science

### Script:

> Brain freeze isn't just a party trick topic. Researchers use it to study migraines, vascular headaches, and pain perception. Your frozen drink mishap is actually contributing to medical science.

## Slide 9: The Science Summary

**Shot:** `dialogue` | **Camera:** `medium` | **Mood:** `warm`
**Duration:** 14.079s

### Key Points:
- Cold → Vessels → Nerve → Pain
- Tongue fix works
- Now you know!

### Script:

> So to recap: Cold hits palate. Blood vessels freak out. Trigeminal nerve misfires. Brain thinks head is in danger. You feel pain. Warm tongue fixes it. Simple!

---

## Slide 10: Embrace the Freeze

**Shot:** `dialogue` | **Camera:** `medium` | **Mood:** `warm`
**Duration:** 15.932s

### Key Points:
- Marvel at neuroscience
- Fix it fast
- Keep eating!

### Script:

> Next time brain freeze hits, don't curse your ice cream. Marvel at the complex neuroscience happening in real-time inside your head. Then press your tongue up, fix it in seconds, and keep eating. Because science.
