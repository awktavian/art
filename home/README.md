# Home — Complete Integrated Environment

**Green Lake, Seattle**

An artisanal showcase of a completely integrated smart home environment with 600+ capabilities, 100+ devices, and seamless digital-physical orchestration.

## Design Philosophy

This showcase represents the pinnacle of home automation craft — where every interaction is delightful, every element is precisely considered, and the complexity of 24 integrated systems dissolves into intuitive simplicity.

### Typography
- **Display**: Newsreader (editorial sophistication)
- **Body**: Inter (technical precision)
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono (system authenticity)
- **Scale**: Perfect Fourth (1.333) for mathematical harmony

### Visual Language
- **Sophisticated color palette** rooted in house materials
- **Bourbon Oak** (#C4941D) for warm accents and interactions
- **Onyx Oak** (#2C2A26) for structural elements
- **Calacatta Quartz** (#F7F4EF) for pristine surfaces
- **Warm stone spectrum** for content hierarchy

### Interaction Design
- **Micro-delights** in every interaction
- **Physics-based animations** using sophisticated easing curves
- **Parallax background canvas** with particle systems
- **Cursor tracking** and ambient visual feedback
- **Keyboard navigation** for accessibility

## Technical Architecture

### Capabilities Showcased
1. **Physical Environment** — 100+ devices across lighting, climate, audio, security
2. **Digital Workspace** — 500+ tools across productivity, communication, development
3. **Sensing & Awareness** — Multi-device tracking, health monitoring, pattern learning
4. **Automation & Orchestration** — Cross-domain triggers and adaptive intelligence

### Performance Features
- **Canvas-based backgrounds** with sophisticated particle systems
- **Intersection Observer** animations for smooth reveals

## Key Features

### Artisanal Details
- **Time-aware greetings** that change based on hour of day
- **Breathing grid overlays** with subtle animation
- **Ripple effects** on card interactions
- **Staggered feature animations** for elegant reveals
- **Cursor-responsive gradients** within capability cards
- **Scroll-synchronized navigation** with active state tracking

### Sophisticated Animations
- **Canvas particle systems** with connection mapping
- **Smooth scroll reveals** with intersection observers
- **Card lift effects** with realistic shadow physics
- **Timeline pulse animations** with radiating effects
- **Navigation state transitions** with micro-feedback

### Responsive Excellence
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Touch-friendly interactions** on mobile devices
- **Adaptive typography scaling** across screen sizes
- **Performance-optimized** animations and effects

## Development Notes

Built with vanilla JavaScript for optimal performance and zero dependencies. The design system is built on CSS custom properties for easy theming and dark mode support.

All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility, and the experience gracefully degrades on older browsers while maintaining core functionality.
